## LinTO Maker Releases

**Latest version: 1.1**

:::note
We currently do not plan to distribute further builts for these. As the provided images relies on older Buster Raspian OS you might want to use our [OS Generator](osgenerator) to build a new image with latest version of Raspbian or other Raspberry PI OSes. The OS Generator toolchain is a quite complete tool that emulates a Raspberry Pi ARM on your developpement computer.
